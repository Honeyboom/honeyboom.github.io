                    We feel so thrilled to launch our first online coaching program, that we decided to add in a little bonus: you can now get our eBook <i>“Play, Laugh, Love”</i> when you apply for our coaching!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this second edition of our first eBook, we have compiled 60 super fun activities that you can use to bring more play and love to your relationships, as well as give your social life an extra dose of excitement. These activities have helped us stay together through the hardest moments in our relationship, by balancing them out with joyful play, kindness, and the ability to free our inner children with each other.
