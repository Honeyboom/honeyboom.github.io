			<h2>Relationship Coaching</h2>
			<p>
				What are the necessary ingredients for a healthy relationship? Love, support, patience… but you’ve heard it all before—and more, you probably even practice them. But you know there is more to it.

			</p>
			<p>
				You don’t just want a “healthy” relationship: you want an <i>extraordinary</i> relationship, one that feels both safe and exciting, one that transforms your life everyday. You’ve done dating, you’ve done long term, perhaps you’ve even explored your way out of monogamy and into wilder territories—but you have known for a while that something else is missing.

			</p>
			<p>
				You want your relationship to be <i>outstanding</i>. You are aware that life is about constant growth, and you want your relationship to be the ground that will make you blossom. You want more than support: you want to <i>create together</i>. You want to take your relationship beyond the realms of body and mind into something deeper, full of purpose and bliss. You might not know yet how to get there—or even what that would look like for you—but you know that there’s more to life and love than what the average relationship in our society have to show for. And now, you are ready to take the next step.
			</p>
			&nbsp;

			<h3>How can we help?</h3>
			<p>
				If what you have just read has resonated and triggered excitement in you, than you are in the right place.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this is the first time you meet us, welcome. We are Silvia and Michal, and it’s a pleasure to have you here. We have been together for over 4 years, and you can find out more about our story and our relationship tools by checking our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFkEEtX7yPtYD0Om0GPwL7w">Youtube channel</a>.

			</p>
			<p>
				But let’s get straight to the point: we can help you because we have been there. We have struggled for meaning and passion, and we have found it. Today, our relationship is quite out of the ordinary—and so is its story.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the day we met and fell in love, we have:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>survived (and rocked) long distance,</li>
				<li>explored non-monogamy and relationship anarchy as a polyamorous couple,</li>
				<li>built a business together and traveled the world,</li>
				<li>inspired and coached our friends and families in changing and improving their relationships,</li>
				<li>explored the potential of long breaks and self time for healing and strengthening our passion,</li>
				<li>found (almost) magical ways to stay attracted to each other everyday single day,</li>
				<li>put in place mechanisms to overcome jealousy together,</li>
				<li>and so, so much more.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We don’t want you to do the same things we did: just because they were right for us, it doesn’t mean they would work for you. We want to help you find and create your own tools to build your own, unique, extraordinary relationship, regardless of your sexual orientation, gender, age, relationship model or religious beliefs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our sessions are tailored to you, to your preferences and to your uniqueness.
			</p>
			&nbsp;

			<h3>What to expect:</h3>
			<p>
				We believe coaching is about empowerment and ultimate freedom, and therefore each of our sessions is tailored to help you unlock your own unique ideas, and access your inspiration and strength.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our coaching approach is based on compassion, confidentiality and openness. We don’t believe in “tough-love” or pushy tasks, but instead in empowering support. We use methods such as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nonviolent Communication</li>
				<li>Active empathy</li>
				<li>Emotional integration</li>
				<li>Effective goal setting</li>
				<li>Storytelling and quest setting</li>
				<li>Authentic relating games</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If this sounds exciting to you, let’s embark on this journey together! If for some reason it feels overwhelming, or if you just think it’s not the right time in your life to do this, then that’s also perfect! We will always be open to receive you and support you in your journey in any way we can, and you can always drop us an email with any questions you might have at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.

			<h2>Life Coaching</h2>
			<p>
				If we asked you to describe a perfect day, what would it include for you? Working on your own successful business? Hiking in the Nepalese mountains or snorkelling in the shores of a Thai island? Completing the first chapter of that book you’ve been wanting to write for years but never had the time?
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever dreams make you jump with excitement—even if it’s just having more free time to spend resting and doing nothing—it’s in your power to make it come true.
			</p>
			<p>
				Think about it this way: if you live up to the age of 90, that means you have at your disposal, from the day you were born until the day you die, a total or 32,850 days to spend. If you are 25, that means that you have 23,725 until you reach that age. If you’re 52, 13,870. As the sun rises each morning, that number goes down by one, whether you want it or not. That’s out of your control.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, what is entirely in your hands is what you choose to do with each of those precious days. Do you choose to spend them in bored despair, doing a job you hate and hoping that one day things will magically change? Or do you choose to feel grateful and excited, fulfilled by a life of purpose and passion—and begin the journey to achieve that?
			</p>
			&nbsp;

			<h3>What is my passion?</h3>
			<p>
				Maybe you haven’t yet discovered your true passion. Or maybe you have, but you haven’t yet figured out how to find the time and energy to pursue it.
			</p>
			<p>
				In any case, it doesn’t matter: if you have read this far, it’s probably because you know that there is something more to life. You can sense that there is something extraordinary awaiting you—and that is enough. You are at the edge of a turning point, and all you need is an extra push.
			</p>
			&nbsp;

			<h3>How can we help?</h3>
			<p>
				<i>“When I finished university, I had no clue what to do with my life. All I could think was “What did I even study this for?” I worked random jobs to sustain me while I looked for my passion. I knew I had to abandon certain beliefs and expectations, and that’s what I did. I began my personal development journey by moving to a new country, creating intentional routines, and finding my own version of spirituality. And then, everything changed.”</i>—Silvia
			</p>
			<p>
				If this is the first time you are here, hello. We are Michal and Silvia, and it’s a pleasure to meet you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have watched our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFkEEtX7yPtYD0Om0GPwL7w">Youtube channel</a>, you probably know a few things about us: we run our own business, we travel the world as a lifestyle, we have a loving, supporting, exciting relationship, and our biggest passion is to help others find their ideal lifestyle and live their dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever it is that you want to achieve—whether it’s financial sustainability, mental and spiritual development, or just finding what is your true passion—we believe all you need are three simple ingredients:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Intention</li>
				<li>Strategy</li>
				<li>Action</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Don’t know how to apply those? This is exactly where we can help you. Throughout the path to achieving our own personal success, as well as coaching, chairing and facilitating others for over 6 years (check below for more information about our experience), we have learned and developed goal-achieving mechanisms that we are now ready to share with you.

		<h3>What is our experience and qualifications?</h3>
		<p>
			Although we have only recently launched our online coaching program, our backgrounds are rich in facilitating, chairing, and coaching experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			We both (Silvia and Michal) have years of experience chairing and facilitating groups in team building, productivity and public speaking (mostly within the context of the <a target="_blank" href="https://eyp.org/">European Youth Parliament</a>). We have done coaching and person centred support with people from challenging backgrounds (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.epilepsyscotland.org.uk/">Epilepsy Scotland</a>), helping them to reach life changing goals and transform their relationships with themselves and others. We have created and facilitated interactive immersive experiences, which focused deeply on exploring and experimenting with the limits and the power of human interactions (<a target="_blank" href="http://hiddendoorblog.org/about/">Hidden Door Festival</a>, Lethally Harmless Productions).
		</p>
		<p>
			We have also been publishing in the field of relationships, human connection, and self development, for platforms with up to a 200 000 readers (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/">Better Humans</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/">Medium.com</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://psiloveyou.xyz/">P.S. I Love You</a>). <a target="_blank" href="https://helloiamsilvia.com/">Click here</a> to check more of our published work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from that, between the two of us we have completed—among others—the following courses and certifications:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chairs Academic Training - European Youth Parliament</li>
			<li>Vipassana Meditation </li>
			<li>Youth Facilitator Certificate</li>

			<li>PVG (UK) Membership</li>
		</ul>
		&nbsp;

		<h3>Can you tell me more about the Free Coaching Offer?</h3>
		<p>
			As a celebration of the very beginning of our online coaching program, we decided to offer you the possibility of winning a free 4 Week Online Coaching Package (either Relationship Coaching, or Life Coaching).
		</p>
		<p>
			This offer expires on the 18th of March at 23:59 UTC, therefore we will only accept applications sent before that date. This offer is limited to 3 people, therefore we won’t be able to accept all the applications. However, if you apply, we will send you future notifications about major promotions and discounts, and you might get access to other opportunities.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you give us your first name and email address, an email will be sent to you with further details, as well as instructions for you to complete the application process—together with a copy of the ebook <i>“Play, Laugh, Love”</i>.
		</p>
		<b>
			Free Coaching Terms & Conditions:
		</b>
		<p>
			This offer is subject to selection. This means that your email application does not guarantee that you will receive free coaching. By providing us with your email address, you get qualified for our selection process, through which we will choose only 3 people who will get 4 free coaching sessions. By applying, you are also being added to our email list, which means you might receive future emails, offers and promotions from Honeyboom. You may unsubscribe at any point.
		</p>
		&nbsp;

		<h3>If I get accepted for free coaching, when does it start?</h3>
		<p>
			The sessions are due to start from the 26th of March to 1st of April. After you get accepted, we will arrange a schedule that will fit both ours and your preferences, therefore the specific date for the first session of the package will be discussed later. The remaining 3 coaching calls will take place within one week intervals.
		</p>
		&nbsp;

		<h3>What do I need for the coaching sessions (materials, preparation, etc)?</h3>
		<p>
			As the coaching will be happening online, the only thing you need is internet connection. No previous coaching experience is required, and all the work will begin when we meet for the first time.
