		<h2>Relationship Coaching</h2>
		<p>
			What are the necessary ingredients for a healthy relationship? Love, support, patience… maybe something like passion, or empathy. Anyway, you’ve heard those a million times before—and more, you probably even practice them.
		</p>
		<p>
			But you know there is more to it. You don’t just want a “healthy” relationship: you want an extraordinary relationship, one that feels both safe and exciting, one that transforms your life everyday. You’ve done dating, you’ve done long term, perhaps you’ve even explored your way out of monogamy and into wilder territories—but you have known for a while that something is missing.
		</p>
		<p>
			You want your relationship to be outstanding. You are aware that life is about constant growth, and you want your relationship to be your fertiliser. You want more than support: you want to create together. You want 1+1>2—to take your relationship beyond the realms of body and mind into something deeper, full of purpose and bliss. You might not know yet how to get there—or even what this would look like for you—but you know that there’s more to life and love than what the average relationships in our society have to show for. And now, you are ready to take the next step.
		</p>

		<h3>How can we help?</h3>
		<p>
			If what you have just read has resonated and triggered excitement in you, than you are in the right place.
		</p>
		<p>
			If this is the first time you meet us, welcome. We are Silvia and Michal, and it’s a pleasure to have you here. We have been together for over 4 years, and you can find out more about our story and our relationship tools by checking our Youtube channel.
		</p>
		<p>
			But let’s get straight to the point: we can help you because we have been there. We have struggled for meaning, passion, and something that we couldn’t really grasp, and we have found it. Today, our relationship is quite out of the ordinary—and so it its story:
		</p>
		<p>
			Our relationship is more than just sexy words, break up and make up, deep talks or good sex. Since the day we met and fell in love, we have:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>survived (and rocked) long distance,</li>
			<li>explored non-monogamy and relationship anarchy as a polyamorous couple,</li>
			<li>built a business together and traveled the world,</li>
			<li>inspired and coached our friends and families in changing and improving their relationships,</li>
			<li>explored the potential of long breaks and self time for healing and strengthening our passion,</li>
			<li>found (almost) magical ways to stay attracted to each other everyday single damn day,</li>
			<li>put in place mechanisms to overcome jealousy together,</li>
			<li>and so, so much more.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We don’t want you to do the same things we did: just because they were right for us, it doesn’t mean they would work for you. We want to help you find and create your own tools to build your own, unique, extraordinary relationship, regardless of your sexual orientation, gender, age, relationship model or religious beliefs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our sessions are tailored to you, to your preferences and to your uniqueness.
		</p>
		&nbsp;

		<h3>What to expect:</h3>
		<p>
			We believe coaching is about empowerment and ultimate freedom, and therefore each of our sessions is tailored to help you unlock your own unique ideas, and access your inspiration and strength.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our coaching approach is based on compassion, confidentiality and openness. We don’t believe in “tough-love” or pushy tasks, but instead in empowering support. We use methods such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nonviolent Communication</li>
			<li>Active empathy</li>
			<li>Emotional integration</li>
			<li>Effective goal setting</li>
			<li>Storytelling and quest setting</li>
			<li>Authentic relating games</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If this sounds exciting to you, let’s embark on this journey together! If for some reason it feels overwhelming, or if you just think it’s not the right time in your life to do this, then that’s also perfect! We will always be open to receive you and support you in your journey in any way we can, and you can always drop us an email with any questions you might have at <a href="mailto:hello@honeyboom.xyz">hello@honeyboom.xyz</a>.
