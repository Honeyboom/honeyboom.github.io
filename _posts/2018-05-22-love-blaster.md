Authentic relating games are experiences that give their participants a real taste of the joy of interpersonal connection in its full splendor. Whether you want to connect deeper on an emotional level, feel appreciated, or simply have incredible amounts of fun with your partner, family, or even strangers, authentic relating can help you do that while you explore yourself and your relationship with others around you.
