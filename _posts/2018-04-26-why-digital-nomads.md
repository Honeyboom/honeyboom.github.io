Why do we travel all the time? Do we have a home? In this video, we explain why we choose the “digital nomad” life. Why we move from country to country every few months, and why you can also do it if your heart tells you to. Looking for some inspiration to ditch your job and live the location independent lifestyle? We hope you enjoy this video!
