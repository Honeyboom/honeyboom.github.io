A few weeks ago we had one of the most powerful experiences in our life – Aquatic Therapy (or Water Flow). In this video, our beautiful friend Linoi explains the meaning and the power behind this practice – how it helps us connect with our emotions and our pre-birth trauma, and even how it affects the way we connect with other people. This session has definitely transformed something inside us, and we highly recommend it!
