Minori and Wik are a Japanese-Dutch couple who started an intentional community in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. In this video they talk about their relationship with each other, about parenting their 1 year old daughter, and they tell us about Dana Village, their community project which they have been growing for the past couple of years.
