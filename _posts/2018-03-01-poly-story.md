 In this video we share about why we transitioned from a monogamous to a polyamorous relationship, how it happened, challenges we faced, and what are the benefits of being in an open relationship. We also share our thoughts on being a polyamorous couple, and how having different partners has shaped our unconventional relationship into what it is today.
