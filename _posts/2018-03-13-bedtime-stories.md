In this video we share with you a little activity that we love doing together and that brings this special feeling of coziness to our relationship, while allowing us to express our creativity and charisma with each other. Itâ€™s very easy, and you can do it anywhere. One hint: you have probably done it with your parents when you were a child! If you are looking for activities to do in your relationship, or ways to get closer to your partner, this might very well be the one for you. We hope you enjoy!
