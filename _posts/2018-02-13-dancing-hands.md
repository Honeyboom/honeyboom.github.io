Dancing Hands is a relaxing game that helps you relax while connecting deeply with another person. You can play it anywhere—while you wait in the queue for the doctor’s appointment, at the disco, as a celebration for your wedding anniversary, or just because you feel like it. Release the tension and let your hands do the dancing!

Heart-to-Heart Game Series is a collection of games and activities aimed at making your relationships more fun, more fulfilling, and more loving. Each game has a different purpose, and you can find activities to play with your partner, with your family, with your friends, or even with strangers.
