In this video we show you some creative minimalist gift ideas that you can do yourself for no money at all, and that will blow your friends’ minds with love and originality.

Have you ever wondered what to offer to your minimalist friend for Christmas? Or maybe you really want to give something to your partner for her birthday, but you are tired of spending money and bringing more clutter to your lives.

The good news is, often people care more for the love and the intention behind the act of giving a gift, than the gift itself. Besides, some of the most beautiful gifts we have ever received were not objects and were completely free to make!
