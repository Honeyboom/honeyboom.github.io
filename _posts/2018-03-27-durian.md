In this video we show you how to pick and eat a good durian. We also talk about our struggle with emotional eating, and share some tips to resist food cravings, step into your willpower and live a healthy lifestyle. This video is more raw and unedited and spontaneous than our usual videosâ€”let us know if you like this style and we will put up more of it!
